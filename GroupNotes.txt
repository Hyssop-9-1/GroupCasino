(Liz, 7/19/23)Return to question about bets vs payToPlay in GamblingPlayer interface.  Is this a necessary distinction?
(Liz, 7/20/23) Add options to add more players in the Casino app.  Suggest recommended player # for the game.
(Manny, 7/20/23) Ask about win cond for slots if we wanna hard code values or create method so its more modular





Manny - slots does not ask the player to spin the wheel on the first turn. Also cant fix the scuffed test, testing the method prompt spin in the SlotsPlayer class
Manny - if Ace comes first in the, also ask taylor how to instantiate one card and check it for tests
